                        The troupe puts on at least three major musical theatre productions a year.

                    <p class="text-white">We pride ourselves on being a welcoming and encouraging group and anyone can be involved with the ushers. We’re a sociable bunch and many people have met life-long friends (and quite a few partners) in our group.</p>
